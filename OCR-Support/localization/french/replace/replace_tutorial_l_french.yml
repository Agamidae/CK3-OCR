lesson_basics_welcome:1 "Welcome to Crusader Kings 3"
lesson_welcome_desc:2 "You are a medieval ruler! Your reign may be brief, but through your heirs you can bring your dynasty to prominence. Land is yours for the taking, by way of the sword or through marriage, and clever diplomacy can extend your reach far beyond the wildest dreams of any conqueror...\n\n There is no one way to "win" in Crusader Kings 3, only different ways to enjoy your story as it unfolds."
lesson_basics_paused_intro_desc:1 "Crusader Kings 3 spans hundreds of years and many generations. Right now, time is standing still because the game is  paused.\n\n For this part of the tutorial, we'll keep the game paused while we walk you through some game concepts."
lesson_basics_tooltips_in_tooltips:1 "Tooltips ($lesson_basics$)"
lesson_basics_tooltips_in_tooltips_desc:2 "First, let's make sure Autohotkey works, because you might get stuck without it due to tooltips.\nMany words in the game have tooltips: popups with additional information that appear when you place the cursor on the word.\nThe only way to dismiss a tooltip is by moving the mouse away. And we do it with Autohotkey, by pressing Control D.\nIf you don't have Autohotkey yet, pleace grab it from the discord server.\nNow, let's practice. On the next page there is a sentence with a tooltip. Place the cursor on it and scan the screen to read the tooltip."
lesson_basics_tooltips_practice: "Practice tooltips ($lesson_basics$)"
lesson_basics_tooltips_practice_desc: "[highlighted_text|E]"
lesson_basics_tooltips_in_tooltips_hover_word:0 "Place the cursor on the word [highlighted_text|E]"
lesson_basics_tooltips_in_tooltips_hover_word_deeper:0 "Follow the instructions."
lesson_basics_web_of_titles_desc:2 "Now, let's talk about the  game! Its world consists of large and small territories â€” landed [titles|E] held by various [rulers|E]. The smallest are holding, also called baronies, â€” these can be castles, cities, temples or tribes â€” and holdings are grouped into counties. Only county rulers and higher can be independent.\n\nCounties can be grouped into duchies, duchies into kingdomds and kingdoms into empires.\n\nYou are a duke of Munster, ruling over 3 counties with 9 holdings total, although in Ireland dukes are called Petty Kings."
lesson_basics_realm_desc:3 "Minimize this window with Escape and then press F one to open your character window.\nThere is quite a lot of information, and we will walk you through it. For now, try opening the lists of your counties, they are hotkeyed to number one. From there you can use other numbers to switch tabs to holdings, titles or claims.\nOnce you're done, you may close any windows with Escape and press Home to reopen the tutorial and continue."
lesson_basics_map_modes_desc:1 "As a [ruler|E], you can only hold so much land on your own â€” you will often have other $game_concept_rulers$ helping with the administration of the [realm|E] by holding land ([titles|E]) within your borders, making them your [vassals|E].\n\nVassals pay a portion of the taxes and levies they get from their holdings to their liege. You have 1 count vassal who owns Ormond and rules over holdings in that county.\n\nYou both are feudal rulers and can only own castles directly. Cities and temples in your land are held by mayors and priests."
lesson_basics_characters_desc:1 "You play one of many [characters|E] in this world.\n\n You will need to make sure that your [dynasty|E] survives and thrives throughout the ages. Your [titles|E] give you power and control over territory, as well as over other Characters (who might hold Titles and land of their own)."
lesson_basics_characters_click_on_character:0 "Open your character view with F one."
lesson_basics_skills_desc:3 "[characters|E] have [skills|E], indicating their proficiency within a certain field. Some are great talkers, while others prefer to make their intent clear on the battlefield.\n\nThe main Skills are:\n[diplomacy|E]:\nImproving others opinion of you.\n[martial|E]:\nRaising and commanding armies.\n[stewardship|E]:\nManaging your personal lands.\n[intrigue|E]:\nScheming and finding secrets.\n[learning|E]:\nStudying theology and technology.\n[prowess|E]:\nFighting in duels or battles as a knight."
#[GetPlayer.GetSkill('diplomacy')].
lesson_basics_traits_1_desc:2 "[characters|E] also have [traits|E], which can affect [skills|E], as well as how they react to things. They are listed under personality and traits in the character view and you can find their description by placing the cursor on them and reading the tooltip.\n You are:\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$[GetTrait('temperate').GetName( GetNullCharacter )],\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$[GetTrait('wrathful').GetName( GetNullCharacter )],\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$[GetTrait('impatient').GetName( GetNullCharacter )].\nFrom this, you can see that your $game_concept_character$ typically leads a modest life and expects others to do the same, and is quick to anger when they don't.\n\nSome Traits tell you about a $game_concept_character$'s personality, like [GetTrait('fickle').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], [GetTrait('calm').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], or [GetTrait('generous').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]. Other Traits are specific to how a $game_concept_character$ has lived their life, such as an [tutorial_education_trait|E] or [commander_traits|E].\n\nWhen a Character chooses to behave contrary to their personality Traits, it can cause them [stress|E]."
lesson_basics_traits_2_desc:1 "[traits|E] can also impact how other [characters|E] react to  you.\n\nSome people are impressed by the [GetTrait('brave').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] Trait, while a [GetTrait('lustful').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] Character is more likely to feature in salacious gossip...\n\n Traits influence other Characters' morality and greed, which can affect both their friendly and hostile actions."
lesson_basics_resources_1:0 "Gold ($lesson_basics_resources$)"
lesson_basics_resources_1_desc:2 "To further your goals you will need [gold|E]. Among other things, $game_concept_gold$ pays for [buildings|E], [armies|E], and bribes. $game_concept_gold$ is collected passively from both your [holdings|E] and your [vassals|E] as [tax|E]. Larger $game_concept_vassals$ and more important $game_concept_holdings$ tend to give more $game_concept_tax$.\n\nHowever, money can't buy everything â€” certain things can only be achieved by spending the right amount of [prestige|E] or, for religious matters, [piety|E].\n\n You can see the current state of your Gold, Prestige, and Piety by pressing R, after closing the tutorial. Press R again or Escape to close that view.\n"
lesson_basics_resources_2:0 "Prestige ($lesson_basics_resources$)"
lesson_basics_resources_2_desc:2 "Your [prestige|E] tells you how respected you are. It can be earned passively over time (by holding many [titles|E], for example) or actively (such as by [marrying|E] into prestigious [dynasties|E] or fighting as an [ally|E] in [wars|E]).\n\nWhenever you earn $game_concept_prestige$, you build towards your next [prestige_level|E], which can be seen in the tooltip for prestige. Higher $game_concept_prestige_levels$ make other [characters|E] think better of you and bring powerful ways to wage $game_concept_war$.\n\n Some actions  cost $game_concept_prestige$, like declaring $game_concept_war$. These actions allow you to leverage your celebrity for your own benefit, and $game_concept_characters$ won't think less of you for using them.\n\nSpending $game_concept_prestige$ does not affect your $game_concept_prestige_level$ progress, just your current $game_concept_prestige$."
lesson_basics_resources_3:0 "Piety ($lesson_basics_resources$)"
lesson_basics_resources_3_desc:2 "With a lot of [piety|E], you will have an easier time interacting with your [head_of_faith|E]. As you are $catholic_adherent$, this is the Pope.\n\n$game_concept_piety$ can be gained passively from the [learning|E] [skill|E] and [virtuous|E] [traits|E] or actively from pious actions, such as going on a [pilgrimage|E].\n\nYou also have a [piety_level|E], seen in the tooltip for piety, which builds over time whenever you gain $game_concept_piety$ and can have positive effects for your Character.\n\n Similar to Prestige, some actions require you to  spend $game_concept_piety$, like declaring [holy_wars|E] or creating a new [faith|E].\n\nSpending $game_concept_piety$ like this is normal, and other [characters|E] won't think worse of you for it."
lesson_basics_lifestyle_open_window_tt:2 "Open the Lifestyle menu by pressing Control F or open F one view and select the Lifestyle button there."
lesson_basics_interacting_1_desc:1 "Now, having selected a [focus|E], we can move on to other people! Interacting with other [characters|E] is key in Crusader Kings 3, and you have many options for how to do so.\n\n You can right-click on most characters' names, including your own, to get a list of potential [interactions|E], such as arranging a [marriage|E] or initiating a [scheme|E]. This is also where you start [wars|E], but let's save that for later."
lesson_basics_open_character_view_tt:0 "1. Open your Character view with F one."
lesson_basics_open_interactions_tt:2 "2. Select your [player_heir|E], with Page Down (they are at the bottom of the page).\n3. Click their name to see availalble Interactions."
lesson_basics_send_gift_tt:2 "Confirm a  Send Gift Interaction with your $game_concept_heir$."
lesson_basics_interacting_3_desc:1 "Well done! You have successfully  increased somebody's [opinion|E] of you.\nIf you close this window, you'll see an update on the screen. Backspace will open the update feed â€” this is where  mildly interesting but non-critical information appears, and goes away after a little while when unpaused.\n\nCertain Opinion modifiers last forever, like family bonds. Others will wane over time, like the fading memory of receiving a monetary gift...\n\n If you open your heir's window again and place your cursor over his opinion of you, it will show where exactly the various numbers are coming from. Is it due to a marriage alliance, a gift of gold, or simply that they appreciate your honest nature?"
lesson_basics_many_lives_2_desc:5 "As long as your [titles|E] have [heirs|E] of your [dynasty|E], your legacy will live on. When your current [character|E] dies, you simply start playing a new one: the [player_heir|E].\n\nDepending on the type of [succession|E] your [realm|E] has, this is likely to be one of your children â€” perhaps one that you have groomed to [Concept( 'ruler', 'Rule' )|E]?\n\nYou can click on your house name from the character view to see more details about your dynasty.\n\nYou don't need to do anything with this now, just know for the future."
lesson_basics_succession_tab_tt:0 "Inspect the Succession tab."
lesson_basics_renown_desc:2 "As a member of a [dynasty|E], you also have [dynasty_prestige|E]. Shared by everyone in your $game_concept_dynasty$, $game_concept_dynasty_prestige$ grows in several different ways and reflects how (in)famous your  Dynasty is, rather than just you.\n\nIncreasing your $game_concept_dynasty_prestige$ will echo down the generations for your descendants, raising your [dynasty_prestige_level|E]. As the [dynast|E] (the most powerful member of your $game_concept_dynasty$), Renown will allow you to unlock [dynasty_perks|E] that will benefit all of your kin.\n\n To view the $game_concept_dynasty_perk$ of a Dynasty, go to your character view and select your house, then choose Open Legacies."
lesson_basics_open_interactions_marriage_tt:0 "Right-click on Character's name."
lesson_basics_open_interactions_marriage_alt_tt:0 "Right-click on an  unmarried Character."
lesson_basics_marriage_view_tt:1 "Select  Find Spouse."
lesson_basics_find_spouse_concept_desc:1 "Choosing  Find Spouse opens a list of potential [spouses|E] â€” they hail from [courts|E] all over the world!\n\nChoosing  Arrange Marriage also opens a list of potential [spouses|E], but only with people from the [court|E] of the Character you clicked.\n\n Your own Character is listed at the top, because this Marriage needs  your approval. Whoever is the [liege|E] of the other spouse will appear below, as the union will need their approval as well.\n\n Arrange Marriage can be useful for match-making between your [courtiers|E] or for setting up a specific marriage [alliance|E]. For now,  Find Spouse is more relevant for our purposes."
lesson_basics_choosing_a_spouse_desc:2 "There are many factors to consider when choosing a [spouse|E]. To help you out, there is a filter function available to pare down the list of candidates. Aspects to consider include potential [alliances|E], [skills|E], personality [traits|E], expected [fertility|E], and more.\n\nSome Traits are [congenital|E], meaning they might be inherited by your children â€” perhaps someone with a Trait like that is a good place to start?\n\n After you select someone, you can change your selection by clicking the  Clear Characters button. Nothing will happen until you click  Send Proposal."
lesson_basics_de_jure_cbs_desc:4 "We say "legally" because, as Crusader Kings 3 lets you play with history, there is no way to guarantee that a [king|E] is  actually in control of all the [titles|E] that his [kingdom|E] is "supposed" to contain within its borders.\n\nWe call this $game_concept_title$ hierarchy [de_jure|E], and if the structure has been broken it is often possible to declare war over errant territories.\n\n If you press Shift+S, it will select your capital. You will see what counties are next to it and its de-jure hierarchy. Clicking the Petty Kingdom of Munster will open the title view for it, listing all de-jure counties. One of them is not owned by you!"
lesson_basics_change_map_mode_1_tt:1 "Select your capital with Shift+S."
lesson_basics_change_map_mode_2_tt:0 "Select Petty Kingdom of Munster."
lesson_basics_holdings_and_buildings_desc:3 "As you saw, the [de_jure|E] Title of Munster consists of four [counties|E]. $c_thomond$ and $c_ennis$ are held by you directly, $c_ormond$ is held by your [vassal|E], and $c_desmond$ is held by a neighboring [ruler|E].\n\nBut before we start any conquests, let's develop our own land."
lesson_basics_buildings_desc:3 "Holdings inside these counties can have a number of buildings that you can construct and upgrade, depending on the [holding_type|E].\n\n We suggest you start by upgrading the  $building_curtain_walls_01$."
lesson_basics_start_construction_tt:1 "Select your capital Holding, with Shift+S.\nSelect  $building_curtain_walls_01$ among its buildings and  Upgrade the structure."
lesson_basics_taxes_desc:1 "Every [holding|E] provides [taxes|E] to their [holder|E]. If that Holder is a [vassal|E], they will in turn pay Taxes to their [liege|E].\n\nTaxes are your main source of [gold|E] [income|E]!\n\n [obligations|E] can affect how high or low these Taxes are. Being at [war|E] can affect the level of [control|E] in a [county|E], which in turn affects Taxes."
lesson_basics_realm_view_tt:2 "Open the Realm view with F2."
lesson_basics_vassals_tab_tt:0 "Inspect the Vassals tab."
lesson_basics_vassals_concept_great_job_desc:2 "Here is a list of your current [vassals|E], along with some additional information about them.\n\nAt the top of the list is the [ruler|E] of $c_ormond$ â€” this is an Earldom (a [county|E]-[title_tier|E] [title|E]) inside your [realm|E].\n\n Come here for an overview of things, such as your Vassals' current [opinion|E] of you, whether they are considered a [powerful_vassal|E] or not, and the levels of [taxes|E] and [levies|E] they are currently providing you with."
lesson_basics_domain_2_desc:2 "Note that there is a limit to how much land you can hold personally, before you start incurring penalties: the [domain_limit|E]. Press R to see it.\n\n When you go above your Domain Limit, it can be a good idea to use the  Grant Title interaction on [characters|E] you are friendly with, making them your [vassals|E].\n\nAs you have no spare titles to give away, you cannot currently do this, but you would otherwise find it in the $game_concept_character$ menu, visible when right-clicking on a $game_concept_character$."
lesson_basics_council_view_tt:1 "Open the Council view with F4."
lesson_basics_council_tasks_desc:1 "[councillors|E] can be set to work, and they all do different things!\n\nYou can change a Councillor's task and see what each does by reading the tooltip.\n\n Being a Councillor is a prestigious position â€” [powerful_vassals|E] expect to be appointed and will be unhappy if left out."
lesson_basics_intrigue_view_tt:0 "Open the Intrigue view with F6."
lesson_basics_schemes_tab_tt:1 "Inspect the Schemes tab (it should be open by default)."
lesson_basics_schemes_sway_complete_desc:2 "Excellent! Once set in motion, your [scheme|E] will slowly progress over time. The time before a conclusion is reached varies based on the Scheme's [success_chance|E], which can be affected by relevant [skills|E] â€” in this case it is affected by your [diplomacy|E].\n\n If you are unhappy with your Scheme, you can always cancel it by clicking Abandon Scheme button next to the Scheme."
tutorial_basic_schemes_start_swaying_tt:2 "Right-click on the name of your [court_chaplain|E] (your "$councillor_court_chaplain_theocrat_duchy$") and choose  Sway (Scheme)."
lesson_basics_hooks_complete_desc:4 "This [weak_hook|E] can be used for a number of things. For example, you can increase the [obligations|E] set by the [feudal_contract|E] you have with a Feudal Vassal.\n\n Note: vassal contract window isn't accessible yet.\nTo access the menu for changing your Feudal Contract, go to your Vassal list in the Realm view, or right-click his portrait to choose  Modify Feudal Contract.\n\nYou may notice that some interactions are not immediately visible. When you have many interactions available, the [character|E] interaction menu only displays the most common ones.\n\nTo display missing interactions, click the "More..." button in a category."
lesson_basics_culture_elements_desc:0 "A [culture|E] is defined by its [ethos|E], [culture_pillars|E], and [traditions|E]. Each determines various benefits or penalties to all members of the Culture.\n\nThe  Ethos describes the core values of a Culture, and cannot be changed. It is the main determiner of what Traditions are available to a Culture. [SelectLocalization( GetPlayer.IsValid, 'lesson_basics_culture_elements_desc_INGAME', '' )]\n\n Cultural Pillars reflect the origins of a Culture, and also cannot be changed. They have a strong impact on the [cultural_acceptance|E] of other cultures, but otherwise are of lesser importance than the Ethos.\n\nThe  Traditions of a Culture are more flexible, but can still be incredibly important to a culture. Unlike the Ethos and Pillars, Traditions can be changed by the Culture Head, which is our next topic."
lesson_basics_warfare_desc:1 "[war|E] is an essential part of Crusader Kings 3. There are many concepts to cover, but for now, let's touch briefly on some of them.\n\n The rest, and the details, we will let you discover as you start playing."
lesson_basics_military_view_tt:1 "Open the Military view with F3."
lesson_basics_rally_points_desc:2 "When a [war|E] starts, you can raise your [armies|E] with a single click of "$RAISE_ALL$" button that will appear together with the $game_concept_war_score$ icon to the lower right of your screen â€” you can of course $RAISE_ALL$ from this Military view as well.\n\nWhen a $game_concept_war$ is over, you have to disband your soldiers before starting another $game_concept_war$.\n\n [rally_points|E] are mustering grounds for the [levies|E] and [men_at_arms|E] under your command; this is where they will appear when called to war."
lesson_declare_war_tt:1 "Select your capital with Shift+S.\nGo to Desmond, South-West of you.\nRight-click the county holder, Earl Muiredach and declare War on him."
lesson_raise_troops_step_1_desc:2 "You have successfully declared [war|E]! Next, you should rally your [armies|E]. A button has appeared at the bottom of your screen to help you, but you can also do this from your Military view.\n\n Wherever your [rally_point|E] is (in this case, $c_thomond$), that's where your [army|E] will gather and await your orders.\n\nNote: you will have to unpause the game (press the 'Spacebar'!) for your $game_concept_army$ to gather more than a handful of men. Leave it for a few days, and the Army will be at full strength!\nOpen the outliner with O to be able to easily select your army and see enemy armies."
lesson_army_movement_step_1_desc:2 "With your army selected, you will see a list of hostile forts - or one in this case, the capital - these are castle holdings in your enemy's counties.\nTo move your army, click on the fort in the list to pan camera to it and press Control 2, so Autohotkey right-clicks in the center of the screen. You will hear a metallic sound.\n\n If you order your $game_concept_army$ across waters, it will [embark|E], turning it into a [fleet|E]. For now, let's stay on land."
lesson_siege_mechanics_step_1_desc:3 "Your [army|E] is attacking an enemy [holding|E]!\n\nYou need to win $game_concept_sieges$ to win most wars, as they increase your [war_score|E].\n\nWhenever a $game_concept_siege$ is won (it takes a few rounds of attack), the area will become [occupied|E]."
lesson_guided_final_notes_mission_step_1_desc:3 "There are many things you could do now that you have dipped your toes in some of the essential systems â€” Crusader Kings 3 is about setting your own goals.\n\nIf you want a suggestion, we recommend you try to become the King or Queen of all $k_ireland$! [war|E] is not the only way, either...\n\nOr you can click the  Current Situation button up top and see if any of the items under Suggestions or Current Situation strikes your fancy!"
