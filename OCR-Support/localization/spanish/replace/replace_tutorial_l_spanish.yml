A duchy is a landed title, and titles give you power and control over territory, as well as over other Characters (who may hold titles and land of their own).\n\nThe smallest titles are baronies that grant control over holdings: these can be castles, cities, temples or tribes. Baronies are grouped into counties, counties into duchies, duchies into kingdoms and kingdoms into empires. Not all titles are created at the start of the game, for example, there is no King of Ireland yet (but you might change that)."

You in return are called their liege.\n\nVassals pay a portion of the taxes and levies they get from their holdings to their liege.\n\nBoth you and your vassal are feudal rulers and can only own castle holdings directly, and any cities and temples in your counties are held by mayors and priests.

We say "legally" because a king is not always in control of all the [titles|E] that his [kingdom|E] is "supposed" to contain within its borders.\n\nIf this [de_jure|E] hierarchy has been broken it is often possible to declare war over errant territories.

As a [ruler|E], you have the help of your [council|E].\nPress F4 to open the Council.\n\nThere is a Council position corresponding to each [skill|E], and married [rulers|E] will also have their [spouse|E] assisting them.\n\nYou can appoint either [vassals|E] or members of your [court|E] to act as your trusted advisors in the council.\nBeing a Councillor is a prestigious position â€” [powerful_vassals|E] expect to be appointed and will be unhappy if left out.\n\n[councillors|E] can be set to work, and they all do different things. They can convert faith and culture in a county, improve relations with other rulers or raise your taxes and levies.\n\nSelect a councilor to see more details and read the tooltips for their tasks."

lesson_basics_council_view_tt:1 "Open the Council view with F4."
lesson_basics_council_tasks_desc:1 "Note that some tasks are used on a specific county or character, like Increase Development that we've mentioned earlier. They are better used from the Task menu in the county view, but here you can preview their effects in the tooltip.\n\nOne such task you'll often use is your Bishop's Fabricate Claim, which is the primary way of expansion. You can select any county controlled by another character, open Tasks and fabricate a claim on it, which will allow you to declare war for that county, once the task is complete.\n\nNote that Bishop is the local name for the position, the more general term is Court Chaplain.\n\nSince you are Catholic, you cannot manually change your Bishop, unlike other councillors. Instead he is appointed by the Pope and you can only pray that you'll receive a skilled character. Unless, that is, you make an unwanted Bishop disappear with a quiet murder scheme..."


#### schemes ####

lesson_basics_schemes_concept_desc:4 "[schemes|E] are long term actions, aimed at another Character. You can find them in character interactions. They can have hostile goals, like trying to [GetScheme('murder').GetTypeName] or [GetScheme('abduct').GetTypeName] your target, or be more wholesome, such as the [GetScheme('befriend').GetTypeName] Scheme.\n\nA good time to use a [scheme|E] might be when you find the [line_of_succession|E] to not be as clear-cut and favorable as you'd like â€” one way to get ahead is to simply remove the competition.\n\nQuietly, and with no witnesses.\n\nA [GetScheme('murder').GetTypeName] attempt comes with a risk of discovery. If your attempt goes awry, it will make your [character|E] unpopular â€” especially with your intended target."

lesson_basics_schemes_murder:0 "$lesson_basics_schemes_concept$"
lesson_basics_schemes_murder_desc:3 "A good time to use a [scheme|E] might be when you find the [line_of_succession|E] to not be as clear-cut and favorable as you'd like â€” one way to get ahead is to simply remove the competition.\n\nQuietly, and with no witnesses.\n\nA [GetScheme('murder').GetTypeName] attempt comes with a risk of discovery. If your attempt goes awry, it will make your [character|E] unpopular â€” especially with your intended target."

lesson_basics_schemes_sway_desc:0 "The Sway [scheme|E] is made for increasing the [opinion|E] someone has of your Character. Let's try it!\n\nThe opinion of your bishop determines whether he pays you taxes and levies. While he isn't shown as your vassal, he does control all the temple holdings in your realm and pays you a portion of income if he endorses you, i.e. has positive opinion of you.\n\nThe council window says whether he endorses you or not."
tutorial_basic_schemes_start_swaying_tt:2 "Open council with F4,\nRight-click your $councillor_court_chaplain_theocrat_duchy$'s name and choose Sway (Scheme).\nAlternatively, open his character view and click the name there to open interactions.\nConfirm the scheme"

 lesson_basics_hooks_desc:3 "Sometimes [schemes|E] can give rise to [secrets|E] â€” if you catch someone trying to commit [GetScheme('murder').GetTypeName], it's probably in their best interests to make sure you keep it quiet.\n\nYou can also [blackmail|E] them, to gain a [hook|E]! $game_concept_hooks$ represent a favor you can call in or a hold you have over a particular [character|E], letting you encourage (or force) them to do your bidding.\n\nHooks and secrets are displayed in the Intrigue window, F6, second tab.\n\nAs you play, you'll find many different ways to gain and use $game_concept_hooks$. Experiment with them!"

lesson_basics_intrigue_view_tt:0 "Open the Intrigue view with F6."
lesson_basics_schemes_tab_tt:1 "Inspect the Schemes tab (it should be open by default)."
lesson_basics_schemes_sway_complete_desc:2 "Excellent! Once set in motion, your [scheme|E] will slowly progress over time.\n\nYou can see active schemes by pressing F6, in the intrigue window.\nThere you can also cancel a scheme by pressing Abandon Scheme.\nSchemes are also listed on the main screen, shown when you minimize the tutorial.\n\nThe time it takes to finish a scheme is based on its [success_chance|E], which can be affected by relevant [skills|E] â€” in this case by your [diplomacy|E]."


# lesson_basics_culture_elements_desc:0 "A [culture|E] is defined by its [ethos|E], [culture_pillars|E], and [traditions|E]. Each determines various benefits or penalties to all members of the Culture.\n\nThe  Ethos describes the core values of a Culture, and cannot be changed. It is the main determiner of what Traditions are available to a Culture. [SelectLocalization( GetPlayer.IsValid, 'lesson_basics_culture_elements_desc_INGAME', '' )]\n\n Cultural Pillars reflect the origins of a Culture, and also cannot be changed. They have a strong impact on the [cultural_acceptance|E] of other cultures, but otherwise are of lesser importance than the Ethos.\n\nThe Traditions of a Culture are more flexible, but can still be incredibly important to a culture. Unlike the Ethos and Pillars, Traditions can be changed by the Culture Head, which is our next topic."

### war ###

lesson_basics_warfare_desc:1 "[war|E] is an essential part of Crusader Kings 3. There are many concepts to cover, but for now, let's touch briefly on some of them.\n\nPress F3 to view and manage your military.\nAll wars are fought by [armies|E], through battles and sieges.\n\nMost of your soldiers will come from [levies|E], but you can expand your $game_concept_army$ by employing [men_at_arms|E].\nIt can be very useful to hire at least one regiment of mangonels, to make sieges faster. Try it, you can press T to create a new MAA (men at arms) unit.\nIf things get really tough, you can also hire [mercenaries|E] â€” provided you have the [gold|E]."

lesson_basics_military_view_tt:1 "Open the Military view with F3."
lesson_basics_rally_points_desc:2 "You can only declare war with no armies raised.\n\nOnce a [war|E] starts, you can raise all troops with a single click of "$RAISE_ALL$" button that will appear on the main screen along with a button showing the current war.\nYou can of course $RAISE_ALL$ from the Military window.\n\nBy default, they will be raised at your capital, that's where your [rally_point|E] is. You can move the rally point or add another.\nRaised troops cost more gold to maintain, so be mindful of your finances.\n\nWhen a $game_concept_war$ is over, you have to disband your soldiers before starting another $game_concept_war$."

lesson_basics_casus_belli_desc:1 "To start a [war|E], you'll need a legitimate reason, a [casus_belli|E], against another [ruler|E].\n\nThere are various ways to obtain a $game_concept_casus_belli$: you might have [de_jure|E] [titles|E] that make you the [rightful_liege|E] of your target, you might inherit [claims|E], or you could pursue [holy_wars|E] against nearby infidels.\n\nAlthough these are the most common, there are dozens of different types of $game_concept_casus_belli$ for you to discover and use as you play!\n\nThe easiest and most straightforward way to acquire $game_concept_claims$ is to use [fabricate_claim|E]. This is something your [court_chaplain|E] sees to, and as we've seen, you can access his task in the county window."

####

lesson_basics_pausing_2_desc:1 "Soon, we'll let you unpause the game! There are just a few things to go over first.\n\nFirst, there are five different speeds available.\nPress plus and minus keys to increase and decrease speed or X and Z.\nNumber keys from 1 to 5 set a specific speed, as long as you don't have a window open that also uses them as shortcuts.\n\nIf you close the tutorial, the speed is stated at the bottom of the screen.\nYou can change the speed and pause whenever you want.\n\nSecondly, for certain important events, the game will auto-pause for you.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with playing at lower speeds, increasing the speed when things are quiet or slowing it down when you go to war.\nBe aware that speed 5 is as fast as your hardware can manage, so time can zip by very fast."

lesson_basics_pausing_3_desc:2 "To start the ticking of time, close this window and press space to unpause the game\nYou will hear a tick for each day passed and a louder metallic sound when a month ends.\nYou can adjust the sounds in the Escape menu, mod settings.\n\nOnce you unpause, days, months, and years will go by. Armies instructed to march will move, events will occur on screen, letters will be sent, and [characters|E] will age.\n\nFind a speed that is comfortable for you â€” you can always change it later."

lesson_declare_war_step_1_desc:1 "Now, as a first task, let's remind your neighbor, the Earl of $c_desmond$, who his [rightful_liege|E] truly is... \n\nUsing the character interaction system, declare war on the [ruler|E] of $c_desmond$ and we will walk you through what happens in the flow of a war.\n\nYou can quick-save with Control S. Wait a second and you'll hear a whoosh as a confirmation."

lesson_declare_war_tt:1 "Open your character with F1 and adjacent rulers with A.\nRight-click Desmond or select him and click his name to open interactions.\nSelect declare war and choose any of the two casus belli, right now they are functionally the same. Then confirm"

lesson_raise_troops_step_1_desc:2 "You have successfully declared [war|E]!\nIf you have an ally, you can call them via a Call to War interaction. To find your ally quickly, return to your character view, open diplomacy with Shift D and select "allied to" entry. The interaction may be hidden inside the 2 more actions.\n\nNext, you should rally your [armies|E]. A button has appeared on the main screen to help you, but you can also do this from your Military view. Once you press it, it will automatically select your army.\n\nWherever your [rally_point|E] is (in this case, $c_thomond$), that's where your [army|E] will gather and await your orders.\n\nNote: you will need to press the Spacebar to unpause for your $game_concept_army$ to gather more than a handful of men. Leave it for a few days, and the Army will be at full strength!\nYou can always select your first army with U. When you have multiple, press O to open the outliner and select other armies and see allies and enemies."

lesson_army_movement_tt: "Order your army to move and unpause"

lesson_army_movement_step_1_desc:2 "With your army selected, you will see a list of hostile forts - or one in this case, the capital - these are castle holdings in your enemy's counties that you need to siege.\n\nTo move your army, press F or click on the closest hostile fort.\nIt will pan the camera to it. Then you can press Control 2, so Autohotkey right-clicks in the center of the screen or OCR the screen and right-click manually on the prompt.\nYou will hear a metallic sound and Autohotkey will ding to confirm the click. You can disable its sounds with Shift F12.\n\nThen unpause and let your army move. When it reaches a hostile fort, it will start the siege automatically.\nIf you order your $game_concept_army$ across water, it will [embark|E], turning into a [fleet|E]. For now, let's stay on land.\n\nNote that the enemy might raise their troops as you are marching. Pause after a few days and check if your army window sees any enemies. Once your armies meet, they will battle!"

lesson_siege_mechanics_step_1_desc:3 "Your [army|E] is attacking an enemy [holding|E]!\n\nYou need to win $game_concept_sieges$ to win most wars, as they increase your [war_score|E].\n\nSelect your army and press Enter to open the siege.\nWhenever a $game_concept_siege$ is won (it takes a few rounds of attack), the area will become [occupied|E]."

lesson_losing_wars_step_1:0 "Looming Defeat"
lesson_losing_wars_step_1_desc:2 "This [war|E] is not going well! It might be time to sue for [white_peace|E].\n\nWhile #EMP this#! $game_concept_war$ might be a lost cause, there is no harm in accepting defeat and living to fight another day. Close this window, press Shift W and choose #TUT_KW White Peace#! (or #TUT_KW Surrender#!, if White Peace is unavailable)."

lesson_war_final_notes_reuse:1 "\n\n#TUT The tutorial lessons end here. However, pieces of Advice will still occasionally appear as alerts. Click these Advice alerts to learn more about certain situations or systems that you are dealing with!\n\nNote that they have not been rewritten yet and might refer to unmodded interface elements.\nThey will be updated soon.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions in the discord, people will be happy to help you.\nThank you for staying with us and good luck!#!"

lesson_guided_final_notes_mission_step_1_desc:3 "There are many things you could do now that you have dipped your toes in some of the essential systems â€” Crusader Kings 3 is about setting your own goals.\n\nIf you want a suggestion, we recommend you try to become the King or Queen of all $k_ireland$! [war|E] is not the only way, either...\n\nOr you can click the suggestions button up top, hotkeyed to Tab, and see if anything there strikes your fancy!"

lesson_battle_mechanics_step_1_desc:2 "The outcome of a [battle|E] between two [armies|E] depends on a number of things: the number of [levies|E] both sides have, which (if any) [men_at_arms|E] either side is using, the [commanders|E] involved, and even the [terrain|E] you're fighting in.\n\nIf you close the battle view, press U to select your army and it will show the battle.\nOnce the battle ends, an alert will appear, saying Victory or Defeat. Clicking on it will show detailed results of the fighting."

lesson_warscore_step_1_desc:1 "To get an idea of who is winning in a [war|E], check the war button on the main screen. The percentage is your war score, it goes from -100 to +100, and changes based on [battles|E] and [sieges|E] won or lost, as well as territory occupied. Click on it to open war overview or press Shift W.\n\nAt 100 $game_concept_war_score$, you can force the other side to accept your [peace_offer|E].\n\nConversely, at-100 $game_concept_war_score$,they can force you to accept their [peace_offer|E]."

lesson_warscore_step_2_desc:6 "All [wars|E] end in one of three ways:\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$[victory|E]\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$[white_peace|E]\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$[defeat|E]\n\nThe exact consequences of any of these change depending on the [casus_belli|E].\n\nYou can preview the results by opening the war overview and selecting Enforce Demands or one of the other options.\nFor now you should probably just wait until the enemy capital is fully sieged. Your enemy will likely attack you again, in hopes to reduce your numbers so you can't siege. If that happens, hire mercenaries."

lesson_winning_wars_step_1_desc:3 "Your [war_score] is at #P +100%#!!\n\nYou are now able to enforce your demands. Close this window and press Shift W. It will automatically select Enforce Demands."
