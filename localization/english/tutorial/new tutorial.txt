<new line> From this, you can see that your $game_concept_character$ typically leads a modest life and expects others to do the same, and is quick to anger when they don't.
<new line>
<new line> Some Traits tell you about a $game_concept_character$'s personality, like [GetTrait('fickle').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], [GetTrait('calm').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], or [GetTrait('generous').GetName( GetNullCharacter )].

<new line> Whenever you earn $game_concept_prestige$, you build towards your next [prestige_level|E], which can be seen in the tooltip for prestige. Higher $game_concept_prestige_levels$ make other [characters|E] think better of you and bring powerful ways to wage $game_concept_war$.
<new line>
<new line> Some actions cost $game_concept_prestige$, like declaring $game_concept_war$. These actions allow you to leverage your celebrity for your own benefit, and $game_concept_characters$ won't think less of you for using them.

<new line>
<new line> $game_concept_piety$ can be gained passively from the [learning|E] [skill|E] and [virtuous|E] [traits|E] or actively from pious actions, such as going on a [pilgrimage|E].
<new line>
<new line> You also have a [piety_level|E], seen in the tooltip for piety, which builds over time whenever you gain $game_concept_piety$ and can have positive effects for your Character.
<new line>
<new line> Similar to Prestige, some actions require you to spend $game_concept_piety$, like declaring [holy_wars|E] or creating a new [faith|E].
