 mod_version: "Mod version 0.9."
 mod_changes: "1.Reworked multiple screens and windows: starting bookmark screen, settings, my realm domain tab, vassal contracts, war overview, war results, crusade window.\n2.Changed status messages on the main screen, such as wars, schemes, etc. They are now listed vertically and show more information. Crusades and inspirations are now labeled.\nNote that they might get covered by the outliner if there are more than 5 items. In the future, I can move them to avoid this.\n3. In My realm window, added opinion, faith and culture to the list of counties, added the number of buildings and empty slots.\nYou can hide holdings for a better overview of counties.\nTabs in My realm are hotkeyed to 1, 2, 3. Eventually I want to hotkey all tabs.\nCrown authority can be hidden.\n4. Added some calculations to contracts, explaining how clan taxes and levies work and adding penalties from not being a rightful liege. This happens when, for example, you are a king ruling directly over a count, without owning the duchy. The penalty is also shown in My realm list.\n5. Fixed the list of potential people for court positions.\nUpdated some interactions and localization to bring them up to 1.8.\n6. Map tooltips are now hidden by default.\n7. As an experiment, added an option in the escape menu to switch to observer mode and let AI control your nation. This may be useful in big messy wars. But make a save first, just in case."
