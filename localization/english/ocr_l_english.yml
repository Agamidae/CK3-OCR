 mod_changes: "Added a list of all ongoing wars to the military window.\nCleaned up the window itself, especially mercenaries and holy orders.\nReworked the Change Succession Law window.\nCleaned up My Realm window a little. It won't reset tabs anymore when reopening.\nReworked the window for selecting headquarters of a holy order.\nPrevious changes:\nAdded a list of all existing artifacts in the Inventory window.\nCharacter lists can now be sorted by skill using number keys.\nWhen sorted by skill, its value will appear in front of a character name in the list.\nCouncil positions are also hotkeyed to numbers (excluding the spouse).\nFilters and sort buttons are now fully clickable, you don't need to select the last few words.\nRenamed the default filter option to Show all, so NVDA doesn't skip it.\"
