They can't be hotkeyed, unfortunately.\nAdded names of characters in events and removed their portraits, so the tooltips don't get in the way.\nAdded the word "option" for event options.\nMod version is now displayed on the loading screen, along with the recent changes.\nYou can remove empty allied armies from the outliner, with Clear List button.\nStart game button moved to the top of the bookmark screen."
