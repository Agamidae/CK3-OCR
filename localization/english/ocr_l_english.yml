 mod_version: "Mod version 0.96.1."
 mod_changes: "Reworked battle results. You can now brag about how many peasants your knights have slain.\nHotkeyed holdings in the county view to numbers. They are also ordered better, with empty holdings at the end.\nYou can hide county information with F and go straight to the holding.\nAdded notification titles that were missing. They will sometimes be redundant, but you will finally know who just converted.\nAlso, in a notification about a county under siege, you can place the cursor on its name and press Shift Q to go there.\nAdded hotkeys to open filters in character lists and to exit to main menu and to desktop."
