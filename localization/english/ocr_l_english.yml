 prev_mod_changes: "Previous changes: 0.6. Rewrote the tutorial. Will change it further, but it should mostly work now.\nShift+S opens your capital.\nCtrl+L opens the lifestyle window.\nThat window is improved a little. When you have a perk point, you can hide everything but unlockable perks to speed things up.\nMade a bunch of small changes to other windows used during the tutorial.\nThe camera won't zoom out when panning to duchy, kingdom or empire titles.\nPanning should in general be more accurate. There used to be an offset added whenever a window was open.\nRemoved all text from the map. There is an optional mapmode with text.\nAdded Option text to letter events.\n0.5. Added a list of hostile forts to the army view. It's updated on a daily tick.\nAdded buttons to scroll lists. They can't be hotkeyed, unfortunately.\nAdded names of characters in events and removed their portraits, so the tooltips don't get in the way.\nAdded the word "option" for event options.\nMod version is now displayed on the loading screen, along with the recent changes.\nYou can remove empty allied armies from the outliner, with Clear List button.\nStart game button moved to the top of the bookmark screen.""
