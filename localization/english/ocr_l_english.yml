 mod_changes: "Reworked the event window. Options are now hotkeyed to numbers from 1 to 5.\nOptions will show if you will gain or lose stress or traits.\nYou can hide the description with Shift D and the event window itself with E to interact with other parts of the game.\nTo deal with UI scaling issues, added a prompt to the main menu warning about it.\nFixed some windows not covering the rest of the screen, like the exit confirmation.\nCleaned up the save menu.\nPrevious changes:\nReworked the faith and faith creation windows. You can now make your own Catholicism, with blackjack and concubines.\nReworked inventory, dynasty legacies, and the struggle.\nDid some clean up for the house view, culture, load menu and some decision and interactions views.\nReorganized things a bit in the character view and added more hotkeys.\nAlso added numbered hotkeys for tabs in almost all windows.\nYou can now dismiss all alerts with Control A.\nQuick save now also sends a toast notification that the game is saved."
