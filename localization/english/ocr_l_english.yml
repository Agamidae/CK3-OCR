 mod_version: "Mod version 0.8"
 mod_changes: "1. Added the Knight Manager mod, credit to Lrds.\nYou can disallow groups of people to serve as knights, for example your heir, or anyone with less than 6 prowess. \nAccess it in the knights window, in military, F3.\nKnights list itself is more compact.\n2. Military window is reworked, you can manage men at arms.\nIt should also be easier to hire mercenaries, although the window with their details isn't adjusted yet.\n3. All character interactions will be shown in the right-click menu, without hiding in submenus.\nDisabled interactions will be indicated as such.\n4. Schemes show more information. Both in interaction confirmation and intrigue window, F6.\nThe list of agents is much more compact and informative. (Although note that the game doesn't let us filter for those who can be convinced and sadly, I don't think a mod can solve that.)\n5. Court positions are reworked.\n6. The outliner shows the owner of an army and army composition in the tooltip (place the cursor on the words View Composition).\nThe outliner should find hostile armies more reliably and should finally remove 0 strength units. Warning, it still may be buggy and I am working on it.\n7. Updated the list of hostile forts. It should better understand who controls what now, especially in independence wars. Still an ongoing effort, there may be bugs, \nRemoved some grouping, like "personal forts", so it doesn't mess up distance sorting. Will continue to tinker with it.\n8. Council window has quick navigation links at the top, to select a specific council member and hide the rest.\n9. Added optional numbering for character lists. This could help with scrolling, I imagine. Enable it in the escape menu."
