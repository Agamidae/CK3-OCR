 mod_changes: "Fixed men at arms creation list. It can be scrolled now.\nReworked innovations in the culture window.\nPrevious changes:\n1. Fixed character interactions that were still hiding from the menu.\n2. Made an alert for "You can ask money from pope" so you don't miss it. it will not show up in the current situation, however.\n3. Removed the word "controller" from the county view. That was me doing some testing.\n4. Armies in the outliner show their composition, leader and attrition, if there is any. Army name is removed.\n5. Hostile armies will appear above allies.\n6. Started work on the culture window. Adding new traditions should be much easier.\n7. Added holders to the title window.\n8. In the marriage finder, reversed the order of traits, so congenital traits will appear first.\n9. The outliner can be closed with Escape now. (in addition to the O key)"
