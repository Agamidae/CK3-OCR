 mod_changes: "Reworked notifications (temporary ones, like Siege started, building constructed, etc.)\nAll of them will show descriptions and buttons to select characters or counties. You can dismiss all with Shift+D.\nImproved Decisions window, the list is more compact, so less scrolling needed. It tells when a decision is unavailable.\nReplaced more text icons with text. Now completed requirements in decisions and tooltips will say "complete". Same goes for the title window.\nConfirmation popup for an interaction makes it more clear what's the title of the window and what's the button.\nThe event window will appear above everything.\nResources are now split into lines. Added levels for piety, prestige, renown and army quality."
 prev_mod_changes: "Previous changes: 0.62 Updated for the Bastion patch, re-adjusted the memories window.\nRemoved tooltips from appoint council buttons.\n0.6. Rewrote the tutorial. Will change it further, but it should mostly work now.\nShift+S opens your capital.\nCtrl+L opens the lifestyle window.\nThat window is improved a little. When you have a perk point, you can hide everything but unlockable perks to speed things up.\nMade a bunch of small changes to other windows used during the tutorial.\nThe camera won't zoom out when panning to duchy, kingdom or empire titles.\nPanning should in general be more accurate. There used to be an offset added whenever a window was open.\nRemoved all text from the map. There is an optional mapmode with text.\nAdded Option text to letter events.\n0.5. Added a list of hostile forts to the army view. It's updated on a daily tick.\nAdded buttons to scroll lists. They can't be hotkeyed, unfortunately.\nAdded names of characters in events and removed their portraits, so the tooltips don't get in the way.\nAdded the word "option" for event options.\nMod version is now displayed on the loading screen, along with the recent changes.\nYou can remove empty allied armies from the outliner, with Clear List button.\nStart game button moved to the top of the bookmark screen.""
