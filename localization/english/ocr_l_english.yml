 mod_version: "Mod version 0.97.9."
 mod_changes: "Reworked most of the multiplayer setup. Will need to test it, especially joining as a player.\nAdded directions for adjacent titles and removed their tiers from the list.\nHealth tooltip in the character window now shows weight, height and, for women, breast size.\nAdded a character interaction to open barbershop, where you can choose clothes and hair color. It also displays weight and height.\nCharacter Interactions won't close the character window by default now. You can toggle this from the interactions window itself and it will be remembered until your ruler dies.\nHotkeyed the button to destroy an artifact to X and repair to Tab. Confirmation windows for them will block the rest of the screen now."
